# Jovo Template: Hello World on Lindenbaum

This template contains a Jovo Sample Lindenbaum Cognitive Voice bot with a simple implementation of the Dialog API.

## Quick Start

To use the Jovo Templates, you'll need the Jovo CLI. You can install it globally with NPM.

```sh
$ npm install -g jovo-cli
```

After successfully installing the Jovo CLI, you can install the template using one of the following commands:

```sh
$ jovo new <directory> --template lindenbaum/dialog-api
```

Change your working directory into your newly created project directory and run your voice app:

```sh
# Change working directory to your previously specified directory.
$ cd <directory>

# Install dependencies.
$ npm install

# Run voice app, optionally with a --watch flag to restart on code changes.
$ jovo run [-w]
```

After that, add your Jovo Webhook URL as the endpoint of your project
