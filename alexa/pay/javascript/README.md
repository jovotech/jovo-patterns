# Template: Amazon Pay

Jovo Sample Alexa Skill that uses In-Skill Purchasing.

```text
$ jovo new <directory> --template alexa/pay
```

The template uses the sandbox mode by default. If you plan on deploying the skill to production, don't forget to switch to production mode. You simply have to delete the sandbox properties.

There are multiple `TODO` comments throughout the code. These values have to be adjusted by you, otherwise the template won't run as expected. All of them are values specific to your setup. Check out the [tutorial](https://www.jovo.tech/tutorials/alexa-amazon-pay) for more information on that.
